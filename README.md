## Technical Overview

MarbleAI is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Solana blockchain, designed to leverage advanced artificial intelligence (AI) agents for yield optimization through a proprietary scoring system. This repository focuses on the technical architecture, AI methodologies, and algorithms that power MarbleAI's functionality.

## Architecture

### System Design
MarbleAI employs a microservices architecture that enhances scalability and modularity. Key components include:

- **User Interface**: Developed using React.js, the UI allows users to configure investment parameters and monitor performance metrics in real-time.
- **AI Agent Framework**: This core component houses multiple AI agents that perform asset analysis and yield optimization.
- **Data Ingestion Pipeline**: A robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built with Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming, ensuring timely updates from various data sources.

### Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Utilizes Solana for high throughput and low-latency transactions.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for RESTful API development; Python for AI model training and inference.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data storage; Redis for caching and session management.
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow and PyTorch are employed for developing, training, and deploying machine learning models.

## AI Technology

### Pentheus AI Agent
Pentheus is the primary AI agent responsible for real-time asset analysis and yield optimization. Key features include:

- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Pentheus continuously ingests and processes data streams from multiple sources using Apache Kafka, enabling immediate analysis of market conditions.

- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes advanced regression techniques, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast potential yield opportunities based on extensive historical performance data. The model is trained on large datasets to enhance predictive accuracy.

  \[
  h_t = \sigma(W_h \cdot h_{t-1} + W_x \cdot x_t + b)
  \]

  where \( h_t \) is the hidden state at time \( t \), \( W_h \) is the weight matrix for the previous hidden state, \( W_x \) is the weight matrix for the input, \( x_t \) is the input at time \( t \), and \( b \) is the bias vector.

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implements reinforcement learning algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to adapt strategies based on feedback from prior actions. This allows Pentheus to optimize decision-making dynamically over time.

  \[
  L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \min\left( r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon) \hat{A}_t\right) \right]
  \]

  where \( r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t | s_t)} \), \( \hat{A}_t \) is the estimated advantage function, and \( \epsilon \) is a hyperparameter that controls the clipping range.

### Scoring System
The proprietary scoring system evaluates user profiles using a combination of machine learning techniques:

- **Dynamic Risk Assessment**: Employs ensemble learning methods (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) to analyze user transaction history, liquidity preferences, and market volatility. This generates real-time risk scores that inform investment decisions.

  The risk score \( R_i \) for user \( i \) can be computed as follows:

  \[
  R_i = w_1 X_1 + w_2 X_2 + ... + w_n X_n
  \]

  where \( w_j \) represents the weight assigned to feature \( j \), and \( X_j \) represents the value of feature \( j\).

- **Adaptive Learning Mechanism**: Utilizes unsupervised learning techniques such as K-means clustering to identify patterns in user behavior and adjust risk assessments dynamically based on emerging trends.

### Algorithms
MarbleAI integrates several advanced algorithms to facilitate comprehensive asset analysis and yield optimization:

1. **Time Series Forecasting**: Implements ARIMA and LSTM models to analyze historical market trends and predict future price movements accurately.

   The LSTM model's loss function can be defined as:

   \[
   L = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i)\log(1 - \hat{y}_i)
   \]

   where \( y_i \) is the true label and \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted label.

2. **Anomaly Detection**: Uses techniques such as Isolation Forests to detect unusual patterns in transaction data that may indicate market shifts or risks.

3. **Collaborative Filtering**: Applies user-based and item-based collaborative filtering methods to provide personalized investment recommendations based on similar user profiles.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Employs automated feature selection techniques (e.g., Recursive Feature Elimination) to identify the most relevant variables influencing yield outcomes.
