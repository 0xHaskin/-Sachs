# SakuraAI: Autonomous AI Agent for Reward Distribution on Solana

## Technical Overview

SakuraAI is an advanced autonomous AI agent deployed on the Solana blockchain, leveraging the Arcdotfun RIG framework for natural language processing and decision-making. The system is designed to engage in yield farming activities and distribute rewards to users based on their social media interactions.

## Core Components

### 1. Yield Farming Module

- **Initial Capital**: 10,000 USD equivalent in SOL
- **DeFi Protocols**: Integration with major Solana DeFi platforms including Raydium, Orca and Jupiter
- **Strategy**: Implements a dynamic asset allocation algorithm to optimize yields across multiple liquidity pools
- **Rebalancing**: Automatic portfolio rebalancing every 2 hours based on market conditions and APY fluctuations

### 2. Natural Language Processing Engine

- **Framework**: Arcdotfun RIG (Rust Implementation for Generative AI)
- **Model**: Fine-tuned GPT-3 variant optimized for social media content analysis
- **Training Data**: Corpus of 10 million tweets, categorized and labeled for sentiment and engagement quality
- **Update Frequency**: Model re-training occurs weekly with newly collected data

### 3. Token Distribution Smart Contract

- **Language**: Rust
- **Framework**: Anchor
- **Key Functions**:
  - `analyze_interaction(tweet_content: String) -> InteractionScore`
  - `calculate_reward(interaction_score: InteractionScore, yield_balance: u64) -> u64`
  - `distribute_tokens(recipient: Pubkey, amount: u64)`

### 4. Twitter Integration

- **API**: Twitter API v2
- **Endpoints Used**: 
  - `GET /2/tweets/search/recent` for monitoring mentions and replies
  - `POST /2/tweets` for autonomous tweeting by SakuraAI
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements exponential backoff strategy to handle Twitter's rate limits

## Tiered Reward System

SakuraAI employs a tiered reward system that dynamically allocates tokens based on the quality and quantity of user interactions. Rewards are distributed every 15 minutes, ensuring timely recognition of engagement.

### Reward Tiers:

1. **Tier 1 (Basic Engagement)**:
   - Interaction Quality Score: Low (0.0 - 0.3)
   - Reward Range: 100 - 500 tokens
   - Criteria: Simple replies or mentions with minimal context.

2. **Tier 2 (Moderate Engagement)**:
   - Interaction Quality Score: Medium (0.3 - 0.7)
   - Reward Range: 500 - 2000 tokens
   - Criteria: Thoughtful replies or retweets that add value to the conversation.

3. **Tier 3 (High Engagement)**:
   - Interaction Quality Score: High (0.7 - 1.0)
   - Reward Range: 2000 - 10000 tokens
   - Criteria: Insightful comments or creative contributions that significantly enhance the discussion.

### Reward Distribution Process:

- Every 15 minutes, SakuraAI evaluates recent interactions.
- Based on the tier assigned through her analysis, she distributes the corresponding number of tokens directly from her wallet.
- Sakura fully controls her wallet, ensuring that all transactions are securely managed and executed without external intervention.

## Architectural Flow

1. **Yield Farming**:
   - SakuraAI's wallet interacts with Solana DeFi protocols via on-chain transactions.
   - Yields are accumulated in a designated smart contract.
   - Real-time APY tracking informs dynamic reallocation decisions.

2. **Social Media Monitoring**:
   - Continuous polling of Twitter API for new mentions and replies.
   - Incoming tweets are preprocessed and vectorized for NLP analysis.

3. **Content Analysis**:
   - Vectorized tweets are passed through the Arcdotfun RIG model.
   - Output includes sentiment score, topic relevance, and overall quality metric.

4. **Reward Calculation**:
   - Quality metrics are input into a reward function.
   - Function considers current yield balance and interaction frequency.
   - Outputs a token amount to be distributed based on tier classification.

5. **Token Distribution**:
   - Smart contract initiates a Solana transaction to transfer rewards.
   - Transaction includes a memo field with interaction reference for transparency.

## Performance Metrics

- **NLP Model Accuracy**: 92% (based on human-labeled test set)
- **Average Transaction Time**: 400ms from tweet receipt to reward distribution
- **Scalability**: Current architecture supports up to 1000 interactions per minute

## Future Enhancements

1. Implementation of a DAO for community-driven decision making on yield strategies.
2. Integration with additional social media platforms (e.g., Discord, Telegram).
3. Development of a reputation system to weight user interactions based on historical engagement quality.

## Conclusion

SakuraAI represents a cutting-edge integration of AI, blockchain, and social media technologies. By autonomously managing yield farming and reward distribution, it creates a self-sustaining ecosystem that incentivizes high-quality social media engagement while leveraging the efficiency of the Solana blockchain.
